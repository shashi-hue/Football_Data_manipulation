# âš½ Football Rolling Stats Generator

This project computes rolling statistics for football teams over the last 5, 15, and 38 matches.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Calculates stats like:
  - Goals Scored/Conceded
  - Shots, Fouls, Corners
  - Cards (Yellow/Red)
  - Match Results (W/D/L)
- Separate tracking for home and away teams
- Avoids data leakage by only using **past matches**

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. Loads and sorts raw match data by date.
2. Tracks each team's match history.
3. For every match, looks up the last N games for both home and away teams.
